# 200B-Channelstrip

This is a project I've always wanted to undertake. I've owned this console since the early 2000s, and it has been a reliable companion throughout the years. Initially, I used it as a summing console and a front-end console for tracking. However, as my focus shifted more towards mastering, this console has become somewhat of a museum piece, seeing less action than before. That's why I'm determined to develop a plug-in version of this console, making it accessible to everyone as a valuable tool.
