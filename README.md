# 200B-Channelstrip

This is a project I've always wanted to undertake. I've owned this console since the early 2000s, and it has been a reliable companion throughout the years. Initially, I used it as a summing console and a front-end console for tracking. However, as my focus shifted more towards mastering, this console has become somewhat of a museum piece, seeing less action than before. That's why I'm determined to develop a plug-in version of this console, making it accessible to everyone as a valuable tool. 

This console originally belonged to the Canadian Broadcast Corporation, where it served its purpose for dubbing dialog. When I acquired it, the console was in excellent condition. However, the channel strips were equipped with the original 2101 modules, which featured a fixed 4-band EQ. To enhance the console's capabilities, I made the decision to purchase and replace all of the modules with the more desirable 2105 channel strips.

The 2105 module offers several advantages over its predecessor. It includes a High Pass Filter, and the two mid-bands feature sweepable frequencies, providing the console with a superior set of tools for controlling the tone. This upgrade significantly improves the console's overall performance and versatility.

So what is so special about this console?

When this console was released in the early 80's, it was known to have excellent sonic fidelity.  The frequency response is excellent and could go head-to-head with any of the Large Format Consoles of the day.  While the likes of Neve and SSL are busy catering to the more glamorous installations of the world, Soundcraft was busy taking good care of the more work-a-day professional 16/24-track market.  

The preamps were transformerless.  They were known to be extremely clean at the time and provide a relatively flat frequency response over 20Hz to 20KHz.  To me, it was very similar to the preamps found in the SSL 4K e-series.
