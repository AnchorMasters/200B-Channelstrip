# 200B-Channelstrip

This is a project that I've always wanted to tackle.  I have had this console since the early 2000's.  It has served me well.  I've used this as a summing console and as a front-end console while tracking.  Now, I have moved to more mastering and this console has turned into more of a museum piece as it gets less work then it had in prior years.  I wanted to create a plug-in version of this console so everyone could have access to this tool.
